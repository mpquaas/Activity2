            <p>
                I enjoy the outdoors in any form. I also like to travel, being stationed on coastal bases gave me a bit of an
                affinity for the ocean.
            </p>
            <p>
                I like to travel both within the U.S. and abroad. I've been to 6 countries outside the U.S., most of them for no less than two months.
